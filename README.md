# Paskahousu card game

This is a small card game done in Java using the JavaFX library. Main goal was to keep up the programming routine and to learn a few things about events and GUI in Java.
Right now the enemy "AI" is pretty rudimentary and, quite frankly, pretty useless. It basically randomly chooses any number of cards that are allowed to be played, and often times makes very sub-optimal moves.

## Few things to do in the future:
* Card animations for the AI players
* Option to start a new game without restarting the program
* Better AI
